		<H1>my ideal vacation</H1>
		<p>My ideal vacation would be a train trip across canada. I have traveled alot on via rail going back and forth between Ottawa and Toronto and have always enjoyed the experience. I have always wantedto visit more of Canada and I think seeing the country by rail would be a great way to do so.<p>
